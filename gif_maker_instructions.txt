"""
For this project, you will create a school appropriate gif.
First start by taking a short video (less than 3 seconds).
Send that video to your email so that you can access it on
the Raspberry Pi computers.  Next, you'll write a program to
manipulate the video by adding text, cropping the video, and
adjusting the speed.  You'll submit your final project in our
Google Classroom.  For this project, you may work either
individually or in pairs.

Steps:
1. Create a new folder in your workspace called "gif_project".
2. Place your chosen video clip in this folder.
3. Create and activate a Python virtual environment. 
4. Import moviepy at the top of your program by adding ==> from moviepy import *
5. Find a Google Font that you would like to use and 
   place the chosen font's ".ttf" file in your project space.
6. Create a VideoFileClip object ==> clip = VideoFileClip("name_of_video_file.MOV")
7. If you took the video using an iphone, add this line ==> clip = clip.resized(clip.size[::-1])
8. Scale your clip to an appropriate gif size. ==> clip = clip.resized(0.2) # shrinks clip to 20% of original 
   Width and height should probably be less than 500 pixels.
   You can check the width and height after you scale the image. ==> w, h = clip.size
                                                                     print(w)
                                                                     print(h)
9. Crop your video, if you would like. ==> clip = clip.cropped(x1, y1, x2, y2)
                                   (x1, y1)+-----------------------+
                                           |                       |
                                           |                       |
                                           |                       |
                                           |                       |
                                           +-----------------------+(y1, y2)
10. Create a text clip ==> text = TextClip(
                                          font="your_ttf_file.ttf",
                                          text="your text",
                                          font_size=your font size,
                                          color=(r,g,g),
                                          )
11. If your text runs multiple lines, it might be best to create
    a TextClip object for each row of text.
12. Position text on the screen. ==> text = text.with_position(<arguments>)
13. Create a CompositeVideoClip. ==> output = CompositeVideoClip([clip, text])
14. Adjust the speed if desired. ==> output = output.with_speed_scaled(<scale factor>)
15. Write your gif to output. ==> output.write_gif("name_of_your_gif.gif")
16. Submit your gif in our Google Classroom.  Partner should add a private comment
    letting me know who they worked with.  Partner should press submit in Google
    Classroom also.
